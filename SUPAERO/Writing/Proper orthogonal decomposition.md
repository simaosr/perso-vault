# Proper orthogonal decomposition
POD is a mathematical decomposition technique that determines a set of orthogonal basis functions from a given set of input data. The basis functions are optimal for reconstructing the original data.

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is the factorization of a matrix $\bm A$ into three matrices, as 
$$
\bm A = \bm U \bm \Sigma \bm V^T,
$$
where
